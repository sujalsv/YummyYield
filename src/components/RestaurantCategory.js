//earlier the restaurant category had its own state, hence it was uncontrolled component but now it is receiving showitems as a prop from restaurantmenu hence it is a controlled component
// we have declared state variable in parent component (restaurant menu) hence it is not possible to change  the value of that directly here so I am defining a function in parent component itself and using that function here in child component.
// go through the concept of lifting the state up
